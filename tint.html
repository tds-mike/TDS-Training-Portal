                        <p>Window tinting is a high-skill service that provides tangible benefits beyond aesthetics. We must understand these benefits to educate our customers. Our films provide UV Protection (blocking 99%+ of harmful rays that damage skin and fade interiors), Heat Rejection (keeping the cabin cooler), Glare Reduction (for safer driving), and Privacy.</p>

                                <li><strong>Dyed Film:</strong> Least expensive, provides privacy but offers minimal heat rejection and can fade to purple over time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Carbon Film:</strong> A mid-tier option that won't fade like dyed film and offers moderate heat rejection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ceramic/IR Film:</strong> The premium choice. Contains ceramic nanoparticles that block infrared radiation (heat) without needing to be dark. Offers the highest heat rejection, won't fade, and doesn't interfere with electronic signals.</li>

                                <li><strong>SUVs/Trucks:</strong> Front Sides must be 35% or lighter. Rear Sides & Rear Glass can be any darkness from the factory; if aftermarket tint is applied, it must also be 35% or lighter.</li>
                                <li><strong>Windshield:</strong> No film is permitted on the entire windshield. A visor strip (AS-1 line) is allowed.</li>

                        <p>Window tinting is a "clean room" operation. A single speck of dust, a stray hair, or a fiber from a shirt can ruin an entire piece of film. Success is determined before the film even touches the glass. Minimize air movement (turn off fans), work in a clean, well-lit bay, and wear clean, low-lint clothing. Always be mindful of contamination.</p>

                     <p>Before starting, inspect the vehicle for pre-existing issues:</p>

                        <li><strong>Old Film:</strong> Check for old, failing tint that requires a full removal service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glass Condition:</strong> Note any chips or cracks. Applying pressure or heat to damaged glass can cause it to spread.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Identify any sensitive electronics near the windows that may need to be protected from water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seals & Panels:</strong> Check for worn or tight window seals ("felt") that can make installation difficult or scratch the film.</li>

                    <!-- Shrinking -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Mastering the Shrink: The Most Critical Skill</h4>
                        <p>Film is a flat sheet; glass is curved. Shrinking is the process of using a heat gun to mold the film to the glass curvature on the *outside* before installing it on the *inside*.</p>
                        <div class="education-box">
                            <h4 class="font-bold">Wet Shrink vs. Dry Shrink</h4>
                            <p><strong>Dry Shrink (Soap Method):</strong> Preferred for rear windows. A bar of soap is wiped on the glass to help the film stick while shrinking. It provides more control for large, complex curves.<br><strong>Wet Shrink:</strong> Using slip solution to stick the film. Typically faster and cleaner for side windows.</p>
                        </div>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mt-4 pl-4">
                            <li><strong>Side Windows:</strong> Tack the film down with a horizontal squeegee stroke in the middle. This will create "fingers" (bunched-up film) at the top and bottom. Gently heat each finger until it "wiggles" or lays down, then immediately smooth it out with a hard card.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rear Windshields:</strong> Create a "H" pattern tack (one vertical line down the middle, one horizontal). This divides the glass into four quadrants. Work one quadrant at a time, shrinking from the center tack line outwards, using the defroster lines as a visual guide.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Glass Prep -->

                        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Glass Prep: The "Surgically Clean" Standard</h4>
                        <p>The mantra is: "Spray it, Scrub it, Squeegee it, and Don't Touch It." Any missed debris will be trapped permanently.</p>
                        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mt-2 pl-4">
                            <li>Protect the interior. Place a "soak rope" at the base of the windshield and cover door panels with towels.</li>
                            <li>Lower the side window 1-2 inches. Spray the top edge with cleaning solution, scrub with a white pad, and squeegee clean. Wipe the very top edge of the glass with a lint-free towel until it comes away clean.</li>
                            <li>Raise the window. Meticulously clean the entire interior surface. On older vehicles, a sharp, flat razor blade can be used to remove bonded contaminants.</li>
                            <li>Squeegee the entire window, overlapping strokes. Use a corner card squeegee to force water and debris out from the side and bottom seals. This step, "flushing the seals," is critical.</li>
                            <li>Perform a final spray and squeegee right before application.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mt-2 pl-4">
                            <li>Generously spray the clean interior glass with slip solution.</li>
                            <li>Carefully peel the protective liner from the film, spraying the exposed adhesive side as you go. This is a high-risk moment for contamination.</li>
                            <li>Float the film onto the glass. Position it carefully, leaving a micro-edge (1/16") at the top and ensuring no gaps on the sides.</li>
                            <li>"Lock" the film in place with a gentle squeegee stroke in the center.</li>
                            <li>Spray the top of the film to lubricate your squeegee. Squeegee from the center outwards, using firm, overlapping strokes to force out all water and air bubbles.</li>
                            <li>Use specialized hard cards (e.g., Little Foot, Shank) to push water out from the tight edges and corners.</li>

                        <p>The black dotted edge on many rear windows is a challenge. The standard method is to squeegee firmly and let it dry, which often results in a silvery, uneven appearance. For a perfect, high-end finish, more advanced techniques can be used, such as gently scuffing the dots with fine steel wool before application, or applying a thin bead of specialized adhesive to the border after installation to ensure a solid black look.</p>

                            <li><strong>Contamination Check:</strong> Look for any specs of dust, hair, or fibers trapped under the film. A few tiny specs may be acceptable, but large or clustered debris requires a redo.</li>
                            <li><strong>Edge Gaps:</strong> Are the gaps around the perimeter of the film even and consistent?</li>
                            <li><strong>Bubbles & Lift Lines:</strong> Identify any remaining air/water bubbles and ensure all edges are lying flat against the glass with no "lift lines."</li>
                            <li><strong>Creases:</strong> Check for hard creases in the film, which are permanent and require replacement.</li>
