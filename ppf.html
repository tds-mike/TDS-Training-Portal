                        <p>Paint Protection Film is a multi-layered Thermoplastic Urethane (TPU) film that provides a sacrificial barrier between a vehicle's paint and the hazards of the road. Its primary function is impact resistance against rock chips, but it also protects against scratches, chemical etching, and UV damage. The top layer is a "self-healing" clear coat that can re-form when heated, making light scratches disappear.</p>

                                <li><strong>Full Front End:</strong> The most popular choice. Covers the entire bumper, full hood, full fenders, and side mirrorsâ€”the highest impact areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Track Pack:</strong> Extends the Full Front package to include the A-pillars, roofline, and rocker panels for vehicles that see heavy track use.</li>
                                <li><strong>Entire Vehicle:</strong> Provides complete peace of mind, protecting every painted panel from damage.</li>

                             <p>Using a plotter with software like CORE allows us to cut patterns that are digitally designed for a specific vehicle. This provides extreme accuracy, minimizes blade-to-paint contact, and ensures clean, repeatable installations with perfectly wrapped edges.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-bold">Beyond a "Clean Room" - The Surgical Standard</h4>
                        <p>If tinting requires a clean room, PPF requires a surgical suite. The large, wet adhesive surface of PPF is a magnet for dust, hair, and any airborne particles. A single piece of contamination trapped under the film is a permanent flaw that requires a costly replacement. Meticulous cleaning of the vehicle AND the work environment is the foundation of a quality installation.</p>

                     <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                        <li><strong>Mandatory Paint Correction:</strong> The paint surface beneath the film must be FLAWLESS. Any swirl, scratch, or defect left on the paint will be magnified under the film and permanently sealed in. A minimum of a one-step polish is required on all panels receiving PPF.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Surgical Wash:</strong> After correction, the vehicle must be washed again to remove all polishing oils and dust. Pay special attention to panel gaps, blowing them out with compressed air to remove any hidden debris that could dislodge during installation.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Final Wipe-Down:</strong> The last step before film touches paint is a meticulous wipe-down with CARPRO Eraser. Use multiple clean, lint-free towels. Perform the "nail test": slide the back of your fingernail on the surface. If it grips, it's clean. If it's slippery, there is still residue that must be removed.</li>

                        <h4 class="font-bold">The Two Essential Solutions: Slip vs. Tack</h4>
                        <p>Mastering PPF is about mastering your solutions. They are two sides of the same coin.<br><strong>Slip Solution (ImmoGel):</strong> A high-viscosity soap solution. Its job is to create a thick, slippery layer that allows you to float the film, position it perfectly, and squeegee without premature sticking.<br><strong>Tack Solution (Alcohol/Water):</strong> Its job is the opposite. The alcohol breaks down the slip solution, allowing the adhesive to "bite" into the surface. It is used for locking down anchor points and, most importantly, for setting edges.</p>
                    </div>
                     <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4 pt-4 border-t">Installation Technique: The Glass-Out Method</h4>
                     <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
                        <li><strong>The Float:</strong> Liberally spray both the panel and the film's adhesive side with slip solution. Gently float the film onto the panel. You should be able to move it around freely.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Anchor:</strong> Position the film correctly. Pick a relatively flat area near the center of the panel. Spray the top of the film with slip solution and perform a firm squeegee stroke outwards from the center. This creates an "anchor" point that holds the film in place.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Squeegee:</strong> Working from your anchor point, squeegee outwards towards the edges. Use firm, overlapping strokes (50% overlap). Your goal is to evacuate all the slip solution from under the film, creating a "glass-out" look with no bubbles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conforming & Stretching:</strong> For complex curves (like bumpers or mirrors), you need to stretch the film. Gently pull the film in the direction needed to conform to the curve. A steamer can be used to make the film more pliable. Read the film; it will tell you how much tension it can take before distorting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Setting the Edges:</strong> This is the final, most critical skill. Lift the edge of the film slightly. Spray the underside of the film and the edge of the panel with TACK solution. This neutralizes the slip and activates the adhesive. Wrap the edge and use a squeegee with firm pressure to lock it down.</li>
                     </ol>

                            <li><strong>"Silvering":</strong> Tiny pockets of air or moisture. Can often be pushed out with a squeegee if addressed quickly.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Lift Lines":</strong> An edge that isn't fully adhered. Caused by improper edge setting. Re-lift the edge, clean, re-apply tack solution, and squeegee firmly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contamination:</strong> A speck of dirt or hair under the film. This is a permanent flaw. The only fix is to replace the piece. This is why prep is paramount.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stretch Marks:</strong> Distorted "crows feet" or lines in the film, caused by aggressive overstretching. Requires replacement.</li>

                            <li><strong>Edge Alignment:</strong> Are all edges perfectly aligned with body lines? Are all wrapped edges fully sealed?</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Is the finish perfectly clear and free of any silvering, bubbles, or lift lines?</li>
                            <li><strong>Contamination:</strong> Scan the entire surface for any trapped debris.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overall Finish:</strong> The film should be virtually invisible.</li>

The film is still curing and bonding to the paint. You may notice some small water pockets; these are normal and will evaporate through the film over the next few days."</p>
                            <p class="mt-4"><strong>CRITICAL Aftercare Instructions:</strong> "To ensure a long-lasting installation, please <strong class='text-red-600'>do not wash the vehicle for one week.</strong> After that, regular hand washing is best. When using a pressure washer, stay at least 3-4 feet away from the film and especially avoid spraying directly at the edges."</p>
