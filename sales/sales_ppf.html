            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 section-title">1. Understanding the 'Why' Behind PPF</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">You are not selling a plastic film; you are selling peace of mind. PPF is the ultimate defense against the inevitable damage of daily driving. Frame your conversation around preserving the customer's investment and maintaining that "new car" feeling.</p>
            <div class="space-y-6">

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Ultimate Impact Protection</h3>
                        <p>This is the core function. PPF absorbs the impacts from rock chips, road debris, bug acids, and minor scuffs that would otherwise chip and scratch the paint.</p>

                        <p>The film's top coat is hydrophobic, repelling water and grime. It also contains UV inhibitors to prevent yellowing and protect the paint from fading.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">All our films are made from a high-performance, thermoplastic urethane (TPU). This material is optically clear, incredibly durable, and flexible. However, there are differences in the top coat technology.</p>

                    <p>This is a high-quality film with a strong, clear top coat. It provides excellent impact protection and has self-healing properties. It's the baseline for professional-grade paint protection.</p>

                    <p>This advanced film has all the benefits of standard PPF but includes a built-in hydrophobic top layer. This makes the surface extremely water-repellent and stain-resistant, keeping the car cleaner for longer and making it easier to wash. This is our primary offering and an easy upsell.</p>
