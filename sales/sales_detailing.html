                        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "That's a fair question. The difference is in the time and the process. A quick wash and vacuum takes about 30 minutes. Our full interior detail can take 4 to 6 hours because we're not just wiping surfaces; we're deep cleaning every single component with specialized tools to restore the vehicle to like-new condition."</p>

However, some stains, especially older ones or those from dyes, can permanently set in the fabric. We always do our best, and we'll be able to give you a more specific expectation when we see the vehicle in person."</p>
