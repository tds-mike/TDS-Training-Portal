            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mb-12">Our detailing services are not "car washes." We sell a transformation. For the interior, we restore that "new car feeling." For the exterior, we rejuvenate the paint to a condition that is often better than new. This guide provides the framework for communicating that value.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm mt-2"><strong>Sales Angle (for Decon Wash):</strong> "It's great that you're so attentive to your car's finish.

                            <p class="text-sm mt-2"><strong>Sales Angle (for Maintenance Plan):</strong> "Since you've already invested in protecting your car with a ceramic coating, the best way to ensure it performs perfectly for its entire lifespan is with proper professional maintenance. Our maintenance plan uses the correct pH-neutral soaps and safe-touch methods that will preserve the coating's properties, guaranteeing you get the most out of your investment."</p>

As we discussed, this will remove all the bonded contamination and make the paint perfectly smooth. However, it won't remove the swirl marks we saw under the light. While the car is here and perfectly prepped, it's the ideal time to perform our Paint Enhancement. This one-step polish will remove those light swirls and restore a level of gloss that a wash alone can't achieve. It's really the step that creates that 'wow' factor. Does that sound like the result you're truly looking for?"</p>
