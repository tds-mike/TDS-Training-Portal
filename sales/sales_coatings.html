            <p class="mb-4">You are selling a lifestyle upgrade for the customer's vehicle. A ceramic coating makes the car look better than new and drastically simplifies maintenance. Focus on the long-term visual and practical benefits.</p>

                        <p>A coating adds a measurable layer of optically clear ceramic. This creates a deep, candy-like gloss that is far superior to any wax or sealant.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Ceramic coatings are liquid polymers (typically Silicon Dioxide, or SiO₂) that chemically bond with a vehicle's factory paint, creating a semi-permanent layer of protection. The key differentiators are durability and the concentration of SiO₂.</p>

A coating is highly scratch-<em>resistant</em> to light swirl marks from washing, but it's not scratch-proof. It's a thin, hard layer of glass.

                        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Great question. The price reflects two things: the product and the process. The coating itself is a far more advanced, durable chemical. But more importantly, to ensure it bonds perfectly, we have to perform a full paint decontamination and at least one stage of paint correction to make the paint flawless *before* we lock it in.

                    <p class="mt-1">A ceramic coating will lock in whatever condition the paint is in. You cannot sell a coating without also selling the appropriate level of paint correction to perfect the finish first. This is non-negotiable for a quality result.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold italic mt-2">"Before we apply the coating, our first step is to perform a paint correction. This removes all the swirl marks and imperfections to get your paint looking better than new. We want to perfect the finish before we preserve it."</p>
