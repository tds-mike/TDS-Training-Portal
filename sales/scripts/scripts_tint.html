A lower price often means a lower quality dyed film that can turn purple in a year, or a hand-cut installation that can scratch your glass. We only use color-stable Carbon and Ceramic films, and we use a computer plotter for a perfect, blade-free cut every time. That precision is what you're investing in."</p>
