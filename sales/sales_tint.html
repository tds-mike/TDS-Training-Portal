                        <p class="mt-4">This diagram shows how our advanced ceramic films work. While all our films block over 99% of cancer-causing UV rays (the purple waves), the nano-ceramic particles embedded in our premium films are specifically designed to reflect Infrared (IR) rays (the red waves), which are the primary source of heat. This is why ceramic film offers superior comfort without needing to be extremely dark.</p>

                            <li><strong>The Windshield Upsell:</strong> "While we're tinting the side and rear windows, I highly recommend adding the front windshield with our clear ceramic film. It's the largest piece of glass on your car, and tinting it makes the biggest difference in rejecting heat and keeping the cabin comfortable."</li>
                            <li><strong>The Sunroof/Sunstrip Add-On:</strong> "A lot of our clients also add a sunstrip at the top of the windshield to help with sun glare, or tint the sunroof to reduce that overhead heat. Since we'll already have the car here, it's easy to add on."</li>
                             <li><strong>The Full Package Upsell:</strong> "Now that we've enhanced the comfort and look with window tint, the next logical step to complete the transformation is one of our exterior packages, like a Paint Enhancement, to really make the paint pop and match the new, sleek look of the glass."</li>

                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Thanks for calling The Detail Shop, this is [Your Name]. How can I help you?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Hi, I was just looking to get a price for window tint on my new Honda Civic."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Excellent, I can definitely help with that. So I can give you the most accurate information, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "My name is Sarah."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Great to meet you, Sarah. <em>[Connecting Question]</em> To give you the best recommendation, are you looking for tint more for privacy and the sleek look, or is rejecting that summer heat a bigger priority for you?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Hmm, I guess mostly for the heat. My last car had a black interior and it was unbearable in the summer."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "I know exactly what you mean, it can be brutal. <em>[Problem Awareness]</em> So when you get in your car on a hot day, is the main issue the leather seats being hot, or is it more the sun beating on you while you're driving?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "It's both really. I have to blast the AC for 10 minutes before I can even think about driving."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "That makes perfect sense. <em>[Educate Briefly]</em> Based on what you've said, our Ceramic film is going to be the best solution for you. While our Carbon film is great for looks, the Ceramic film is designed specifically to block infrared heat. It makes a massive difference in comfort."</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Okay, so what does that cost?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "For a full installation on your Civic with the Ceramic film, you're looking at [Price]. That comes with a 10-year warranty against any bubbling or fading."</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Okay, that's a bit more than I was expecting."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> <em>[Diffuse Concern]</em> "I understand. It's definitely a premium product. The main difference you're paying for is that feeling of getting into a car that's significantly cooler every single day. <em>[Consequence Question]</em> How much of a difference would it make for your daily commute if the car was comfortable from the moment you got in, without having to wait for the AC to cool it down?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "That would be a huge difference. I drive a lot for work."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> <em>[Transition/Committing Question]</em> "It sounds like this is the right long-term solution to solve that heat problem for good. I have an opening this Friday morning at 9 AM, would that work for you to get it installed?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Yes, that works perfectly. Let's do it."</p>
