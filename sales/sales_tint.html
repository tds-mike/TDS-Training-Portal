            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 section-title">1. Understanding the 'Why' Behind Tint</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">To sell tint effectively, you need to go beyond "it makes your windows dark." You're not selling a product; you're selling solutions to common problems. The key benefits are your primary selling tools.</p>
            
            <div class="space-y-6">

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">UV Protection: The Health & Preservation Angle</h3>
                        <p>Our films block >99% of UV rays. This is a powerful selling point. Frame it in terms of benefits the customer can relate to: "It's like sunscreen for your car and your family."</p>
                        <div class="education-box">
                            <p><strong>Educate the Client:</strong> "Did you know that UV rays are the primary cause of your car's interior fading and cracking? Our tint protects that investment. More importantly, it protects you and your passengers from skin damage on long drives."</p>

                        <p>This is the most tangible benefit, especially in the summer. It's the difference between getting into a comfortable car versus an oven. This is where upselling to ceramic becomes easy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Educate the Client:</strong> "The number you want to pay attention to is Infrared (IR) rejection.
