                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Thanks for bringing your Porsche in today. So you're interested in one of our ceramic coatings?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Yes, I want to protect the paint and get that crazy shine I see online."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Perfect, you're in the right place. Before we can apply a coating, the first and most important step is to inspect the paint to see what we're working with. Do you mind if I grab my inspection light and show you what I see?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Sure."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> <em>(Turns on swirl finder light and shines it on the door)</em> "See this spider-webbing effect? Those are all microscopic scratches in your clear coat. This is what dulls the finish and stops you from getting that deep, wet-looking gloss."</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Wow, I never saw that before. I thought the paint was in good shape."</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> <em>[Problem Awareness]</em> "It's impossible to see in normal light, but this is what's holding your car back from looking its absolute best. It would be a mistake to apply a coating right now, as it would just lock in all these imperfections. <em>[Educate]</em> We need to perform a paint correction first. Think of it like refinishing a piece of fine wood—you have to sand it perfectly smooth before you apply the new varnish. We do the same for your paint."</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "So you have to polish the whole car first?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> "Exactly. Our One-Step Correction will remove about 70-80% of all those swirls, which will dramatically increase the gloss and clarity. Then, once the paint is perfect, we apply the ceramic coating to 'lock in' that flawless finish."</p>
                             <p><strong>Client:</strong> "Okay, I see. So the price includes both the correction and the coating?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Salesperson:</strong> <em>[Transition/Committing Question]</em> "Yes, they go hand-in-hand. The paint correction is what creates the shine, and the ceramic coating is what protects it for years. It's the only way to do it right. Does that process make sense to you?"</p>
                            <p><strong>Client:</strong> "It does. Let's do the full package."</p>
