                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Clients who ask for paint correction are typically enthusiasts or owners of high-end vehicles who are frustrated by a finish that is anything less than perfect.</p>

                        <p><em>"Think of paint correction like refinishing a high-end piece of wood. You wouldn't put a beautiful new varnish on a table that's covered in scratches and scuffs. First, you have to meticulously sand the surface smooth to create a perfect foundation. That's exactly what we do for your car's paint. We level a microscopic layer of the clear coat to remove all the defects, which is what creates that incredible, deep gloss."</em></p>

                        <li><strong>The Paint Depth Gauge (PDG):</strong> Using a PDG shows a high level of professionalism and care.

                        <li><strong>Level 1 - Paint Enhancement (AIO):</strong> This is primarily for gloss enhancement. It will make the paint look much better but will not remove deeper swirls or scratches. It's perfect for a client on a budget or a car in already good condition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 2 - One-Step Correction:</strong> This is the sweet spot for most vehicles. It will remove ~70% of all defects, resulting in a dramatic visual improvement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 3 - Two-Step Correction:</strong> For the enthusiast who wants a near-perfect finish. This involves a heavy compounding step to remove deep defects, followed by a polishing step to refine the finish to a high gloss. It removes ~85% of defects.</li>
