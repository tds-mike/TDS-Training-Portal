                <p class="text-gray-600">An "objection" is not a rejection—it's a sign of engagement. It's a request for more information, a test of our value, or a concern that needs reassurance. Our job is not to "handle" or "fight" objections, but to welcome them as an opportunity to understand the customer better and guide them to the right solution. A confident, empathetic approach is key.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Understand what their concern *really* is. Paraphrase their concern to show you're listening (e.g., "So it sounds like the main concern is the upfront investment?"). Don't assume you know.</p>

                        <p>"Of course. Just so I know what information would be most helpful for you when you're thinking it over, what's the biggest question on your mind right now?"</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 2: Discuss & Diffuse</p>
                        <p>This objection is often a polite way of hiding the real concern (usually price or needing to speak with a spouse). Your job is to gently uncover it. Once they state the real concern, you can address it directly using the appropriate script below.</p>

                        <p>"I understand. When you say it's expensive, are you thinking about the upfront cost, or the long-term value?"</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 2: Discuss & Diffuse</p>
                        <p>"I agree it's a significant investment, but let's compare it to the alternative. The cost to repaint a bumper from rock chip damage is often over $1,000. This PPF package protects that investment for years and preserves your resale value. To make it more manageable, we do have financing options available. Would breaking it down into smaller monthly payments be helpful?"</p>

                        <p>"That's a great question. It really comes down to what you value more: short-term shine or long-term protection and ease of maintenance."</p>

                        <p>"Wax is like a temporary glow—it looks great for a few weeks, but you have to reapply it constantly. Our ceramic coating is more like adding an extra layer of clear coat. It's a semi-permanent shield that protects your paint for years, not weeks. Would you agree that making your car much easier to clean for years to come would be a huge benefit?"

We are so confident in the technology that we back it with a 10-year warranty against yellowing, cracking, or peeling. Does knowing it's protected by a long-term warranty give you peace of mind?"</p>
