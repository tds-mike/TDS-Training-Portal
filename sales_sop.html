            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mb-12">Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential for delivering a consistent, high-quality customer experience. This framework outlines the process for in-person consultations, combining our NEPQ principles with practical, actionable steps.</p>

                <div class="phase-box">
                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Phase 1: The Warm Welcome & Discovery</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">The goal is to build rapport and uncover the client's needs before you even get to the vehicle. This is where you connect with the client on a personal level.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Welcome:</strong> Start with a warm greeting and thank them for coming in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualify:</strong> Ask a broad, open-ended question to understand their motivation. <em class="text-gray-500">"What brought you in today?"</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Identify the "Why":</strong> Use NEPQ questions to get to the heart of their needs. <em class="text-gray-500">"Is your primary goal to protect the paint, enhance the look, or make the car easier to clean?"</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> Pay close attention to their answers. These details are your key selling points for the rest of the conversation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="phase-box">
                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Phase 2: The On-Site Vehicle Assessment (The Walk-Around)</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">This is where you transition from conversation to a hands-on, educational experience. The walk-around should be about educating and building value, not just selling.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Assess "As-Is" Condition:</strong> Begin the walk-around by politely pointing out any existing scratches, rock chips, or swirls. This builds a case for the need for your services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Educate with the Vehicle:</strong> Use the physical car as a teaching tool. Explain how a ceramic coating would protect against future water spots or how PPF would prevent rock chips.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Physical Samples:</strong> Bring out samples of your ceramic coating, PPF, or window tint film. Let the customer feel the product's quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Offer a Tailored Solution:</strong> Based on your conversation, recommend a specific package that addresses their needs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Phase 3: The Proposal & Close</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">Bring the conversation back to the office to present the final quote and secure the booking.</p>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Review the Proposal:</strong> Walk the client through the itemized quote, explaining the value of each service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Address Objections:</strong> Be prepared to handle common objections like price or timing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encourage Commitment:</strong> Use your committing questions to gently guide the client toward a decision. <em class="text-gray-500">"Based on what we've discussed, does this feel like the right solution for you and your vehicle?"</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Confirm Next Steps:</strong> Once they agree, take the deposit, schedule the appointment, and discuss your referral program.</li>
