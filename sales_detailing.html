            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mb-12">Our detailing services are not "car washes." We sell a transformation. For the interior, we restore that "new car feeling." For the exterior, we rejuvenate the paint to a condition that is often better than new. This guide provides the framework for communicating that value.</p>

                            <li><strong>Decontamination Wash:</strong> The essential entry point to professional detailing. This service removes the embedded iron and tar contaminants that a normal wash leaves behind, creating a truly clean and smooth surface.</li>

                            <li><strong>Advanced Paint Enhancement:</strong> The ultimate exterior transformation. This combines a Paint Enhancement with a long-term <a href="sales_coatings.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Ceramic Coating</a> (1-10 years), locking in the gloss and providing superior protection.</li>

                           <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> <em>"What do you think will happen to those stains if they're left to sit for another hot summer?"</em> or <em>"What happens to the value of the car if that contamination isn't properly removed and the paint starts to fail?"</em></li>

A quick car wash is designed for speed, but their harsh chemicals and brushes can actually damage your paint over time.
