                        <li>"How do you typically use your vehicle? Is it a daily driver, a weekend car, or for the track?"</li>
                        <li>"What are your biggest frustrations with maintaining your car's appearance?" (This helps identify pain points like rock chips, difficult washing, etc.)</li>

                                <br><strong>Recommendation:</strong> "Based on your highway driving, a Full Front End PPF package is the best defense against rock chips. To make washing easier and keep that black paint looking incredibly glossy, we'll top it with a 3-Year Ceramic Coating."</li>
                                <li><strong>Client B:</strong> Has a weekend sports car, is most concerned with keeping it cool in the summer, and wants a sleek look.
                                <br><strong>Recommendation:</strong> "For maximum heat rejection, our Ceramic Window Tint is the perfect solution. It will give you that sleek look you're after while making the cabin much more comfortable."</li>
