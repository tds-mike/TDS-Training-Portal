            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mb-12">Applying a ceramic coating is the final and most critical step in creating a long-lasting, show-car finish. This is not a wax or sealant; it is a semi-permanent, liquid-glass layer that chemically bonds to the paint. Precision, cleanliness, and a methodical approach are non-negotiable for a successful application.</p>

                            <li><strong>Cross-Hatch Application:</strong> Apply the coating to the section in a cross-hatch pattern (first up/down, then left/right) to ensure complete and even coverage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Observe the "Flash":</strong> Watch the applied section closely. After 1-5 minutes (depending on temperature/humidity), you will see the solvent evaporate, leaving an iridescent, "rainbow" or "oil slick" effect. This is the flash. This is your signal to begin removal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leveling Wipe (Towel 1):</strong> With a short-nap microfiber towel, gently wipe over the flashed area. This initial wipe "levels" the coating, knocking down the majority of the residue.</li>

                           <li><strong>If Caught Within Minutes:</strong> Simply re-apply a small amount of coating to the high spot. The new solvents will reactivate the area, allowing you to immediately wipe it off correctly.</li>
                           <li><strong>If Cured (Hours/Days Later):</strong> The high spot must be removed by machine polishing. Use a finishing polish (like CARPRO Reflect) on a foam pad to gently polish the area until the high spot is gone, then re-apply the coating to that spot and blend it in.</li>

The most important thing is to <strong class='text-red-600'>not wash the vehicle for at least 7 days.</strong> Try to avoid parking under trees where birds can target the car, and gently wipe off any bird droppings as soon as you see them with a soft microfiber."</p>

It's very important to use a pH-neutral soap, like the CARPRO Reset in the maintenance kit we offer. Avoid automatic car washes with harsh brushes, as they can damage the coating. Regular, safe hand washes are the best way to maintain the shine and performance for years to come."</p>
