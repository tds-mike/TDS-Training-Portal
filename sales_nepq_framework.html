                <p class="text-gray-600">NEPQ (Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning) is the engine of our sales process. It is a psychological framework that shifts you from a "product pusher" to an expert "problem solver." Instead of telling clients what they need, we ask questions that help them discover their own problems, understand the emotional and logical consequences of those problems, and ultimately persuade themselves that our services are the solution they've been looking for. This builds massive trust and positions you as a helpful consultant.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <h4 class="font-bold">Foundation of Expertise</h4>
                    <p>To ask these questions effectively, you must have deep product knowledge. Review our guides on <a href="sales_tint.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Selling Window Tint</a>, <a href="sales_ppf.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Selling PPF</a>, and <a href="sales_coatings.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Selling Ceramic Coatings</a> regularly.</p>

                    <p class="mb-6">The NEPQ framework is a sequence of questions designed to guide the conversation naturally from introduction to close. It's crucial to ask these with a tone of genuine curiosity, not like you're reading a checklist.</p>
